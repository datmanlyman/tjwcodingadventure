      <p>Hi, I am <b>Jee Wern</b>. I created this website to be my portfolio of being a Computer Science student in Nanyang Technological University(NTU). The website uses Django as the Web framework, PHP for the Web server, CSS template by W3, and HTML. I learnt the aforementioned
        through online tutorials, as NTU does not teach any front-end lanuages. However, I am still deeply inexperienced at those languages.

      <h5 class="w3-teal w3-padding">Re-Think, Re-Consider Webpage</h5>

      <p>Through this project, I learnt about web-crawling in Python, and reinforced my database design knowledge.
      </p>

      <p>We used the web-crawler to crawl articles about HDB blocks (a type of housing in Singapore), and display them on the webpage.
      </p>

      <p>Also, we got our database through a CSV from www.singstat.gov.sg. The CSV had a chunk of rows and columns, so if we got the data from the database without decomposition it would be very slow. Thus, my partner and I designed the database (through VPP) based on the needs of the website, and the information available in the CSV.
      </p>

        <h5 class="w3-teal w3-padding">GetGudGrades Multiplayer Game</h5>

        <p>For this project, we were tasked to design a learning online game. Through this, I learnt C# and Unity based application.
        </p>

        <p>Overall, this was a complicated process. I had to learn a new language and a new platform, while doing a heavy project. However, from the guidance of my teammates, and YouTube tutorials, I was able to keep up.
        </p>

        <p>My partner and I chose to make the interactive part of the game, i.e the forms for the users to fill-up, choosing the characters before starting the game, etc.

        <h5 class="w3-teal w3-padding">Introduction to Database Project</h5>

        <p>We had to design a database for an e-commerce company, from start to finish - Draw the ER Diagram, write the dependencies, made and filled up the SQL database, and dealt with queries.
        </p>

        <p>Through this, I learnt SQL and about the basics of what makes a database.
